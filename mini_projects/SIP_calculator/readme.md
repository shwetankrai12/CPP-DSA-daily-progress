# 💰 SIP Calculator (C++)

A simple and accurate SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) Calculator built using C++ and `while` loops — no external libraries like `cmath` used! 🚀

## 🧠 What It Does

This calculator helps you find out the future value of your monthly SIP investments, given:

- 💵 Monthly investment amount
- 📈 Annual interest rate (%)
- 🗓️ Duration in months

It uses manual compound interest logic, simulating how each monthly investment grows over time — just like a real-world SIP!
